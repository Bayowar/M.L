# Breast Cancer Risk Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on  using machine learning techniques. One of such projects utilizes open source dataset to analyze the impact of imaging biomarkers and social factors on breast cancer progression [here](https://github.com/Bayowar/M.L/blob/ff24c611b14739aac6ef2e8aa645c468ecb8144a/BayowaOnabajo_Final_Codebook%20(2).md)and the other utilizes open source data to analyze automobile features[1](https://github.com/Bayowar/M.L/blob/d5cd613c770102e89e66ecb305808726f84dc205/Exer1/Exer1.md).
